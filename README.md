The core files, classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary are:

1. `app.py`: This is the main Python file that will run the Flask application. It will contain a single route that displays "Hello, World!".

2. `Dockerfile`: This file will contain the instructions to build the Docker image for the application.

3. `requirements.txt`: This file will list the Python dependencies that need to be installed in the Docker image.

4. `test_app.py`: This file will contain the test cases for the application.

5. `.github/workflows/main.yml`: This file will define the GitHub Actions workflow for the application.

6. `pytest`: This will be used to run the test cases.

7. `flake8`: This will be used for linting the Python code.

8. `bandit`: This will be used for security vulnerability scanning.

9. `radon`: This will be used for code quality scanning.
